# Data-Pipeline-for-Sales-Analytics-ETL-Project-
The Data Pipeline for Sales Analytics project demonstrates how raw business transaction data can be transformed into actionable insights through an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow.
ðŸ“Š Data Pipeline for Sales Analytics (ETL Project)
ðŸ”¹ Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL pipeline for processing sales transaction data and generating actionable insights. The pipeline extracts raw data from CSV files, performs transformations using Python (Pandas, NumPy), and loads the processed dataset into a relational database (PostgreSQL/MySQL).

Once the data is stored, optimized SQL queries are used to analyze business performance, including revenue growth, sales by region, and top-selling products. The results are visualized with Matplotlib and Seaborn to enable data-driven decision-making.

This project showcases practical Data Engineering and Analytics skills and serves as a foundation for building scalable pipelines in real-world scenarios.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Extract raw sales data from CSV files

Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, type conversions, outliers)

Transform and structure data for analysis

Load processed data into PostgreSQL/MySQL

Write optimized SQL queries for reporting (aggregations, joins, indexing)

Generate business insights such as:

Monthly revenue trends

Best-selling products

Regional sales distribution

Visualize insights with Matplotlib/Seaborn

Modular pipeline design for scalability and reproducibility

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL

Querying: SQL (aggregations, joins, indexing)

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Version Control: Git, GitHub

ðŸ”¹ How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/data-pipeline-sales-analytics.git
cd data-pipeline-sales-analytics


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Update database credentials in config.py (PostgreSQL/MySQL).
